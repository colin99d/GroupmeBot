No
I've decided to wait
I'll let you know later
How about a movie instead?
I'm not ready
It's getting late
I want my first time to be special
You're crazy
I want to be loved, not make love
I don't do sex
I don't love you
I have to go now
You're just using me
Rub my back instead
I can't support a child
I'm scared
This isn't what I had in mind
Not until we're married
I know your reputation!
Let's stop seeing each other for a while
If you loved me, you wouldn't ask
School comes before sex
We might get caught
Is that all you think about?
I'm allergic to sex
You'll tell everyone
I have a sunburn
It's not worth it.
Let me think about it
I'm waiting for the right person
It's against my religion
My parents would kill me
Let's get something to eat
I just want to be friends
I said "no" and I mean it!
We're too young
Don't ask me to make this choice
I don't feel comfortable
Sex can be more trouble than it's worth
With all these diseases going around?
Not everybody's doing it - I'm not
I just got my hair done
I don't like kids
I don't sleep around
Don't make me laugh
I think I hear my dad
We can find other ways to express our love
If I do, you'll leave me
I've got homework
My parents are waiting up
If we do it now, it could ruin it later
I don't know you well enough
I just want to hold you
I want you to leave
I'd rather watch the game
Have you thought about consequences?
I think my mother's calling
I don't want to
People will think I'm "easy"
Go away
I don't know who else you've slept with
I want to break up until you can wait
Maybe later
I love you too much to have
I'll find my own way to the door
Love isn't just about sex
It's not what I want to do
My favorite show's on now
I thought you were different
I quit last week
The coach said not to
I want to stay a virgin
I have to go to the bathroom
It's past my curfew
It's against my values
I'm too busy
I don't want to have kids now
Ask me again in 5 years
I want to have a career
You ignore me any other time
I don't want to get pregnant
Thanks anyway
I'm not ready to commit
Let's ask my parents
We won't respect each other
I have to get up early
I'm not sure you're the right person
Not tonight
I don't want that kind of pressure
My friends will be here any minute
I don't want our relationship to be just about sex
Let's wait
I'm not looking for this
I need more time
It might ruin our friendship
I want to stop now
Please respect my wishes
I'm afraid of HIV
I love someone else
I'd be sorry later
I want to know you better
